# Specification: Data Reconciliation

**Goal:** Refactor the data processing script (`process_data.py`) to use the `noc_regions.csv` file as the authoritative source for country information.

**Problem Statement:**
The current implementation infers country names from the `Team` column in the main athlete dataset, which is inaccurate. A new file, `noc_regions.csv`, has been provided with a canonical mapping between National Olympic Committee (NOC) codes and country names.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The `countryArray` variable generated by the script must be populated exclusively from the data in `noc_regions.csv`.
2. Each athlete in the main dataset must be correctly associated with their country by matching the `NOC` column from `athlete_events_sample.csv` with the corresponding `NOC` in `noc_regions.csv`.
3. The final `data-generated.js` file should reflect this accurate country mapping.
