# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
- **Minimalist & Modern:** The interface should be clean and unobtrusive, allowing the data to remain the primary focus.

## Visual Identity
- **High Information Density:** Design the UI to maximize data visibility, ensuring researchers can see and compare as much relevant information as possible without unnecessary clutter.
- **Clear Typography:** Use highly legible fonts and structured layouts to maintain readability at high density.

## Messaging Style
- **Direct & Concise:** Labels, instructions, and feedback should be straightforward and brief to minimize cognitive load.

## User Interaction
- **Instantaneous Updates:** All data visualizations and tables must refresh immediately in response to user input (e.g., filter changes), providing a seamless exploration experience.
- **Stacked Filtering:** Support an iterative drill-down approach where users can refine their search progressively.
